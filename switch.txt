If we have many option to chose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have
many cases statements which defines various possible values. Statements are executed from first matched case
value until a break is encountered.
NOTE: case values are tested with strict equality(===). The break statement is used to hault the flow of the
code and come out of the block of the code.

There is a default case in each switch statement. It is there if no case matches default statement automatically
runs and tells no case matched. It is placed at the end as the last statement in the switch statement.
