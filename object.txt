Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
you access the data in objects through properties.
Objects are usefuol for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

There are two ways to access the properties of an object:
1. dot notation(.)
2. bracket notation([])

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.
