Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
you access the data in objects through properties.
Objects are usefuol for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

There are two ways to access the properties of an object:
1. dot notation(.)
2. bracket notation([])

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation([]). if the property of the object
you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

After we created a JavaScript object, we can update its properties at any time just like you would update any
other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

We can add new properties to the existing JavaScript objects the same way we modify them.
