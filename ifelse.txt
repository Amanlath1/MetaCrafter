The another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false.
They are basically on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly
braces under certain conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.
When the condition evaluates to true, the programexecutes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition
evalueates to false, the statement  inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode: 

if (Condition is true) {
    statement is executed;
}
