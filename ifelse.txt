The another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false.
They are basically on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly
braces under certain conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.
When the condition evaluates to true, the programexecutes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition
evalueates to false, the statement  inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode: 

if (Condition is true) {
    statement is executed;
}

There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All these operators return a boolean true or false value.
The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. This is called equality operator. If the value is equal it will give Boolean true.
If the value is not equal it will give Boolean false.

Strict equality === is the counterpart to the equality operator ==. However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both
values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. it means not equals and return false statements where equality return true statements.
