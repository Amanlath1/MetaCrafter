In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
We can call or invoke the function by using its name followed by parentheses.

Parameters are the values that act as a placeholders for the values that are to be
input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically
defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input into a
function when it is called are known as arguments.

We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to
send a value back out of a function.

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of the variables. Variables that are defined
outside of a function block have Global scope. This means they can be seen everywhere in your
JavaScript code.
Variables that are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the
global scope. This can create umintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function
again. You should always declare your variable with let or const.
