When we are defining a string we must start and end with a single or double quote.
what to do when we need literal quotes " or ' inside of our string.

In JavaScript, we can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash\ in front of the quote.

String values in JavaScript can be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with same type of quote.
and we can use both literals in the same string as.
