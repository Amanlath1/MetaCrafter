You can run the sam code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops
that condition is no longer true.

Most common type of JavaScript loops is called for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.
'for' loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.
A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions. In order to decrement by two iteration,
we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.

A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop.

If we have a multi-dimensional array we can use the concept of nesting of the loops to get the desired result.

The next type of loop in JavaScript is called "do-while" loop. It is used to run the code at least one time either the condition
is correct or not. In do there is the code that we want to run. and in while section there is a specific condition that need to be
true to get iterated again.
