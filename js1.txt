Commments are lnes of code that javscript will intentionally ignore.
Commments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other 
people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write the comments in JavaScript:

1. // This is an in-line comment. it is used to write single line commment.

2.  /* This is a multiline comment.
    It is used to comment out multiple lines in the code*/

Comments are very useful as they are used to provide information and matadata and the functioning of the code.


In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
JavaScript provides eight different data types which are:

1. Undefined
2. Null
3. Boolean
4. String
5. Symbol
6. Bigint
7. Number
8. Object

Variables

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather taht using the data itself.
Any of the eignh data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to.
Computer variable differ from mathematical variable in that they can store different values at different times.

In JavaScript we can create a variable by putting the keyword ""Var"" in front of it like,

var var_name;

In JavaScript we can store a value in a variabli with the assignment operator(+)

var_name=5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to var_name.
We can also assign the value of one variable to another variable using assignment operator.
