Commments are lnes of code that javscript will intentionally ignore.
Commments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other 
people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write the comments in JavaScript:

1. // This is an in-line comment. it is used to write single line commment.

2. /* This is a multiline comment.
    It is used to comment out multiple lines in the code*/

Comments are very useful as they are used to provide information and matadata and the functioning of the code.
