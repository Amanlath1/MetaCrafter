Number is the data type in JavaScript that represents numeric data.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

const myvar = 5 + 10;
It now has value 15.

JavaScript uses the - symbol as an substraction operator when placed between two numbers.

const myVar = 12 - 6;
It now has value 6.

JavaScript uses the * symbol as an multiplication of two numbers.

const mul = 13 * 13;
It now has value 169.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division of two numbers.

const div = 4 / 2;
It now has value 2.

we can increase the value of any variable by 1 by using increment operator.

++

we can decrease the value of any variable by 1 by using decreament operator.

--

We can store decimal numbers in variables too.
Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.

The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

const rem = 5 % 2;
It now has value 1.

In programming it is common to use assiignments to modify the contents of a variable. as we us,

myVar = myvar + 5;

it is used to add 5 to myVar

there are some operators which can do mathematical operations and assignment in one step.
One such operator is the += operator

myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
it will change the value to 6.

other operator is -= operator

myVar = 5;
myVar -= 2;
it will change the value to 3.
